# 👋 ようこそ!
Hi, I'm **Gery** 🌟 

I started out as a biology enthusiast and ended up in Japan studying economics. But life had a different plan, and I stumbled upon my passion for coding. 

Now, I'm happily immersed in the world of programming, living in **JAPAN**, eating 豚骨ラーメン 🍜.

## 📚 The Languages I Speak:
1. Indonesian (Native)
2. English (Bilingual proficiency)
3. Japanese (Professional working proficiency)

## 🏆 What's on My Coding Horizon:
- [ ] Crafting a modern-looking tic-tac-toe game using React (Next.js perhaps?)
- [ ] Building a slick markdown blog using Nuxt Content and Supabase
- [ ] Developing my own treasure trove of components
- [ ] A fresh and stylish portfolio website
